# GematriaForTruth
Gematria For Truth Base SDK

The Gematria For Truth platform is an attempt to create a variety of free SDK's for the purpose of creating tools in the field of gematria and numerology discovery.
This package is the base package for Gematria Ciphers and Decoding.  There is still much work to be done in regards to documentation.

This project source and/or package includes,
	
  ->Support for over 36 Predefined base Ciphers and over 200 predefined experimental ciphers.
  
  ->Multiple language support for English, Greek, Russian, Polish, and Jewish Ciphers.
  
  ->Various Predefined Values and Value Categories for the purpose of matching specific number patterns.
  
  ->Calculations for Prime, Triangular, Fibonacci, Square Root, and Perfect numbers.
  
  ->Calculation indexes for Gematria Values with PI(first 1,000,000) and PHI(first 100,000) sequences.
  
  ->Minimal XML configuration support for creating user defined ciphers and user defined match values.

Other packages and repositories will soon be available for,

->Mongo DB Support

->Date Analysis

->WikiData integration

->Web Crawling (gathering of phrases)

->Web Page Analysis

->PDF Analysis

->Date Generation

->Bible and Scripture Analysis

->Word Matching bases on cipher value matches

->And more...

Currently there is a Windows Forms User interface in a somewhat beta release stage build on the platform.
